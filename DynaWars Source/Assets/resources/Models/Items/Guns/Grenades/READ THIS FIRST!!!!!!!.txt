To make the textures for the grenades to work you have to put the jpeg images into the 
Autodesk folder.  It will look like this:
C:\Program Files\Autodesk
Now the textures should work and you ready to have fun. :)
For any complaments, complaints, problems,ect. email me. (email is below)
*Note* When you start the file it will say you are missing the jpegs.Do not worry
because its is refering to some other textures i made that were not applied.
